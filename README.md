# Identify-Customer-Segments
Identify Customer Segments Project from Udacity

This is the last project of the Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch Nanodegree Program from Udacity.

In this project I used a real dataset, I had to cleaned it and re-engineered several features before start standarizing the data. After that, I used a scaler and PCA (Principal Component Analysis), to reduce the features of the dataset, then I fit it into a KMeans model to predict customer clusters.
